Terminal Drop

A fast-paced arcade survival game built with Phaser 3.

Dodge falling obstacles.
Survive as long as possible.
Eventually regret your life choices.

No lore. No menus. No mercy.

Avoid falling red blocks

Survive as long as possible

Score increases over time

High score is saved locally

Collision = instant failure.
Press Space to restart.
Repeat until humbled.

🧠 Design Philosophy

Terminal Drop was built as a small, focused Phaser project:

Single scene

Minimal visuals

Arcade physics

Time-based scoring

Increasing difficulty

The goal wasn’t to build a masterpiece.

The goal was to build something complete.

⚙️ Built With

Phaser 3

Vanilla JavaScript

HTML5 Canvas

Mild frustration

🚀 Running Locally

From the project root:

npx serve .


Open the local URL shown in the terminal.

📈 Difficulty Curve

Obstacles spawn continuously

Speed and/or spawn frequency increase over time

Occasional spawn patterns force real decisions

Overconfidence is punished

You can dodge safely.

Or…

You can attempt to thread a microscopic gap between two descending blocks like an arcade hero possessed.

Which brings us to…

⚔️ The LeRoy Jenkins Clause

At some point, you will see a gap.

It will be small.

It will be questionable.

You will think:

“I can make that.”

And in that moment, you will summon the spirit of LeRoy Jenkins.

You will charge.

You will commit.

You will explode instantly.

That’s not a bug.

That’s Terminal Drop working as intended.

📦 Deployment

The project is structured for static hosting:

index.html at root

All scripts loaded via relative paths

Fixed canvas size (800x600)

Ready for itch.io… if bravery permits.
